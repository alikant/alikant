### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ali, and I study Economics at the University of Bonn. My main focus is Econometrics and Statistics because I am interested in data analysis to quantify real-world phenomena. I enjoy working with R and Python, and I want to delve into Economics with a quantitative approach. :)
