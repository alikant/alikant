### Hi there 👋

My name is Ali, and I am a Master's student in Economics (Econometrics and Statistics) at the University of Bonn.

I am interested in Causal Inference, Difference-in-Differences, and Machine Learning methods.

I enjoy working with R and Python, and you can find my projects on my GitHub page.
